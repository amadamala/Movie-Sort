Movie sorting
=============
This project is to scratch my own itch.  

Normally I make list of movies I want to watch. Whenever I got time I comeback and search imdb for ratings of movies. I watch the movie which has the highest ratings.  
  
Which takes list of movies as input and returns (movie name, rating) in their ratings order.

Todo
=====
* movies.txt file as input
* generate html table may be.
* Take actor's name and generate his movie list in ratings order.
