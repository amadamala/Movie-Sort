Movie sorting
=============
This project is to scratch my own itch.  

Normally I make list of movies I want to watch. Whenever I got time I comeback and search imdb for ratings of movies. I watch the movie which has the highest ratings.  
  
Which takes list of movies as input and returns (movie name, rating) in their ratings order.

I used following api's to search imdb, and google.
[IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/), [xgoogle](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/python-library-for-google-search/)
  
If you have pip or setuptools installed, you can also use one of these commands to install imdbpy:
  *  pip install imdbpy  
  *  easy_install imdbpy
